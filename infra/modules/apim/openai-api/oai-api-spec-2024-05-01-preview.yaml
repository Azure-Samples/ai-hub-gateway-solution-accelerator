Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256" &#58; -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.'

      description: "Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.\n\nEach event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:\n\n```\nevent: thread.created\ndata: {\"id\": \"thread_123\", \"object\": \"thread\", ...}\n```\n\nWe emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being\nstreamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run\nis created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses\nto create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a\n`thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a\n`thread.message.completed` event.\n\nWe may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully\nin your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to\nintegrate the Assistants API with streaming.\n"
