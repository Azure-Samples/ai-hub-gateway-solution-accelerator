## 🚀 Overview

Citadel Governance Hub is an **enterprise-grade AI landing zone** that provides a centralized, governable, and observable gateway plane for AI consumption across teams and environments.

This repository is a **solution accelerator** that helps you deploy and operate the hub using:

- Infrastructure-as-code (Bicep, Terraform)
- A unified AI gateway pattern (Azure API Management)
- Usage ingestion components (Logic Apps + Event Hub + Cosmos DB)
- Validation notebooks and operational guides

## 🏛️ Part of the AI Citadel Blueprint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This accelerator is the **reference implementation of Layer 1 – Governance Hub** in the [AI Citadel Blueprint](https://aka.ms/foundry-citadel) layered security architecture.

The **AI Citadel Blueprint** is a unified, layered approach to AI security and compliance, designed to enable enterprises to scale AI innovation while maintaining trust, security, and regulatory alignment. The blueprint is composed of four interlocking layers:

| Layer | Name | Responsibility | Implementation |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------|
| 🔷 **Layer 1** | **Governance Hub** | Runtime enforcement — unified AI gateway, policy-as-code, identity validation, token rate limiting, content filtering, cost attribution | **👉 This Accelerator** ([aka.ms/ai-hub-gateway](https://aka.ms/ai-hub-gateway)) |
| 🔶 **Layer 2** | **Agent Operations** | Agent runtime, observability & compliance — agent traces, AI evaluations, fleet operations, automated compliance checks | [Microsoft Foundry Agents & Control Plane](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/control-plane/overview) |
| 🟢 **Layer 3** | **Agent Management** | Agent identity & lifecycle governance and security — unique agent identities, blueprints, shadow agent detection, sponsorship model, access packages | [Governing Agent Identities with Agent 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/) |
| 🛡️ **Layer 4** | **Security Foundation** | Unified protection — `Microsoft Defender` for AI threat intelligence, `Purview` for data governance, `Entra` for authentication and authorization | Microsoft Defender, Purview & Entra |

The layers are not isolated silos — they form an integrated architecture grounded in the principle of **separation of concerns with unified oversight**.

**Layer 1: Governance Hub** (this accelerator) acts as the runtime gateway through a hub-and-spoke deployment where a centrally managed AI gateway (Azure API Management) enforces runtime policies, while **Layer 2: Agent Operations** spoke environments give each business unit autonomous development within guardrails.
Adding **Layer 3: Agent Management** ensures that every agent has a unique, governable identity, while **Layer 4: Security Foundation** provides unified threat protection and data governance across the entire architecture.

## �🏗️ Architecture Overview

AI Citadel Governance Hub follows a **Central-Control-Plane** with decentralized **Agent-Execution-Plane** architecture** that integrates seamlessly with your existing `Azure Enterprise Landing Zone` network topology:

![Citadel Governance Hub](./assets/citadel-governance-hub-v1.png)

### Networking approach

Detailed networking approach guidance for Citadel Governance Hub can be found in the [Network Approach Guide](./guides/network-approach.md).

Initial deployments support optional [private-only Logic App website and SCM/Kudu access](./guides/network-approach.md#logic-app-private-connectivity). This is opt-in; defaults remain public access enabled with no Logic App private endpoint.

Below is a high-level overview of the two supported deployment approaches:

#### Part of spoke network (peered to a hub VNet in the connectivity subscription)

In this approach, the Citadel Governance Hub is deployed within a dedicated spoke VNet that connects to the hub VNet via VNet peering.

Agentic workloads in other spokes are routed first to the hub network firewall through direct peering, then forwarded to the Citadel Governance Hub gateway network.

This provides an additional layer of isolation for AI workloads while still enabling secure communication with other enterprise resources in the hub.

This is the recommended approach for large enterprises with strict network segmentation requirements or those who want to isolate AI workloads from other enterprise resources.

#### Part of the enterprise network hub (usually in Connectivity subscription)

In this approach, the Citadel Governance Hub is deployed within the existing enterprise hub virtual network (VNet) of your Azure Enterprise Landing Zone.

This allows for direct communication between the unified AI gateway and connected agentic spokes (as the hub already peered with all spoke networks), leveraging existing networking configurations.

This approach is suitable for enterprises that prefer to integrate the governance hub within their existing network architecture without additional segmentation.

### 🌐 **Agents Onboarding** - for existing and new agents

To govern AI agents through Citadel Governance Hub, agents must communicate with AI backends (central LLMs, tools and agents) through the Citadel's unified AI gateway.

#### Access Contracts

Leverage **Citadel Access Contracts** to declare the required access to LLMs, tools and agents through the gateway along with precise governance policies.

[Access contracts](bicep\infra\citadel-access-contracts\README.md) are infrastructure-as-code declarations of the access requirements and governance policies for an agent, which are then automatically enforced at runtime by the gateway.

>NOTE: Recommendation is to create one contract per business-unit/use-case/environment to allow for precise governance policies and better observability in the hub.

#### Publish Contracts (Preview)

Leverage **Citadel Publish Contracts** to onboard and publish centrally protected AI assets — **Tools (MCP)** and **Agents (A2A)** — through the gateway with per-asset backends, resiliency, baseline policies, usage tracking, and optional API Center registration.

[Publish contracts](bicep\infra\citadel-publish-contracts\README.md) are infrastructure-as-code declarations of the AI assets published on the gateway. See the [Publish Contract Guide](bicep\infra\citadel-publish-contracts\publish-contract-guide.md) for asset types, backend/auth options, and Foundry A2A publishing.

>NOTE: Publish Contracts and Foundry-hosted A2A publishing are available in Preview (`publish-contract-version: 1.0.0-preview`). Publishing an asset does not grant access to it — governed access (products/subscriptions) is handled by Access Contracts.

#### Existing agents

Guidance to bring existing agents is through updating endpoint and credentials to access central LLMs, tools and agents through the **unified gateway** endpoint and credentials that are produced by the access contract provisioning for each agent.

>NOTE: Recommendation is to use Azure Key Vault to store these information due to its sensitivity when the agent is running on Azure.

#### New agents (AI Landing Zone for Microsoft Foundry)

Building new agents is accelerated through the **AI Landing Zone for Microsoft Foundry** guidance, which helps enterprises adopt AI faster by offering a governed, secure, and repeatable foundation for deploying AI applications and agents on Azure at scale.

For detailed guidance and technical implementation, see [AI App Landing Zone Repo](https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones).

**Deployment Approach:**
- **One Agent Execution Plane per business unit or use case** - Deploy dedicated Foundry landing zone environments for each business unit, such as insurance claims processing, customer support automation, or other agentic scenarios
- **Flexible runtime options** - with Microsoft Foundry Agents (fully managed agent runtime) you get to choose between native Foundry agents or bring-your-own agent container frameworks like LangChain, Microsoft Agent Framework, or custom implementations while still benefiting from the unified governance and security of the hub
- **Pre-configured infrastructure** - Automated deployment via Bicep or Terraform with all networking, security, and monitoring built-in
- **Hub integration** - Seamless connection to Citadel Governance Hub through **Citadel Access Contracts**

**Deployment Patterns:**
- **Greenfield (Standalone with New Resources)** - Creates all infrastructure from scratch with new VNet and Log Analytics workspace
- **Brownfield (Standalone with Existing Resources)** - Integrates with existing enterprise landing zones, reusing VNets and centralized monitoring

>NOTE: As per Citadel Blueprint principles for **Layer 2: Agents Operations**, this landing zone provides a standardized foundation for enterprise AI workloads, with implementation options in Terraform and Bicep deployment. By activating **Access Contracts**, agents deployed in this landing zone can seamlessly integrate with the Citadel Governance Hub for unified runtime governance and observability.

## 🔄 Governance Hub Operations - Contract-Driven Governance

Day-to-day operation of the Citadel Governance Hub is **contract-driven**: every change to what the gateway serves and who can consume it is declared as version-controlled infrastructure-as-code (`.bicepparam` files) rather than manual portal configuration. Three complementary contract types govern the gateway lifecycle:

- **🔌 Backend Contracts** — govern the **supply side**: which LLM backends and models the gateway can route to.
- **📤 Publish Contracts (Preview)** — govern which Tools (MCP) and Agents (A2A) are published through the gateway.
- **📝 Access Contracts** — govern the **demand side**: which use cases and agents can consume those models, and under which policies.

Together they create a clean separation of concerns: platform teams curate AI capacity and published assets, while business units onboard use cases against those governed assets without touching gateway internals.

```

### 🔌 Backend Contracts — Onboard LLM backends and models

Declares the **governed AI capacity** the gateway can route to, enabling dynamic backend routing without modifying APIM policies:
- Multi-provider backends (Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, external/OpenAI-compatible providers)
- Automatic load balancing and failover across backends serving the same model
- Model aliases that abstract a client-facing name over multiple underlying models (with priority/weighted routing)
- Dynamic model discovery (`GET /deployments`) so clients and Microsoft Foundry can enumerate available models

> 🔗 **Learn More:** [Governance Hub Backend Contract Guide](./bicep/infra/llm-backend-onboarding/README.md)

### 📝 Access Contracts — Onboard use cases and agents

Declares the governed dependencies an agent or use case needs—LLMs, AI services, tools, and reusable agents—along with precise access policies enforced at runtime by the gateway:
- Model selection and capacity allocation (scoped to the curated backend capacity)
- Per-use-case APIM product, subscription, and policy (one contract per business-unit / use-case / environment)
- Safety and security guardrails (content safety, PII handling, layered API key + JWT authentication, OAuth scopes)
- Usage quotas, cost limits, and flexible credential delivery (Key Vault, Microsoft Foundry connection, or direct output)

> 🔗 **Learn More:** [AI Citadel Access Contracts Guide](./bicep/infra/citadel-access-contracts/README.md)

### 📤 Publish Contracts (Preview)

Publishes Tools (MCP) and Agents (A2A) through the gateway with declarative endpoint and backend configuration, baseline policies, usage tracking, resiliency for supported backend types, and optional Azure API Center registration. Foundry-hosted agents can be exposed as A2A endpoints.

>NOTE: This capability is available in Preview (`publish-contract-version: 1.0.0-preview`). Its contract surface may change before general availability. See the [Publish Contract Guide](./bicep/infra/citadel-publish-contracts/publish-contract-guide.md).

### ✅ Why Contract-Driven Governance

- ✅ **Separation of concerns** — platform teams manage backends; business units manage their own access contracts
- ✅ **Audit-ready traceability** — every backend and access change is captured as reviewable infrastructure-as-code
- ✅ **Faster release cycles** — repeatable, declarative onboarding with automated approvals via DevOps pipelines
- ✅ **Reduced manual effort** — no manual gateway configuration for onboarding models or use cases
- ✅ **Continuous policy compliance** — guardrails are enforced consistently at runtime for every request

## 📋 Deployment Prerequisites (Basic/Fast)

For fast deployment, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

**Azure Requirements:**
- **Azure CLI** and **Azure Developer CLI** installed and signed in
- **Owner** or **Contributor + User Access Administrator** permissions on the subscription
- All required subscription resource providers registered (providers are outlined in the [Full Deployment Guide](./guides/full-deployment-guide.md)).

**Tools:**
Although it is recommended to have the below tools installed on a local machine or through DevOps agents to conduct the provisioning, you still can leverage Azure Cloud Shell (mounted to storage account) as an alternative which has all the tools pre-installed.
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (optional)

>NOTE: Azure Cloud Shell is a great option for quick deployment without local setup, but for ongoing development and operations, having the tools installed locally or in your DevOps environment along with a git-repo will provide a better experience especially when it comes to production deployments.

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

Deploy your Citadel Governance Hub in minutes with Azure Developer CLI:

```bash
# Authenticate and setup environment
azd auth login

# in a new folder, initialize the template (i.e. folder name: ai-hub-citadel-dev)
azd init --template Azure-Samples/ai-hub-gateway-solution-accelerator -e ai-hub-citadel-dev --branch citadel-v1

# Deploy Citadel Governance Hub

## 🏷️ Release Version

The accelerator tracks its release state in a single source-of-truth manifest at the repository
root — [`release.json`](./release.json). Instead of one monolithic version, it uses **independent,
component-scoped version tracks** so a change in one subsystem does not force re-versioning of
unrelated ones:

| Track | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `master-version` | Umbrella accelerator release version |
| `routing-version` | LLM request routing logic (backend pools, model resolution, failover) |
| `backend-contract-version` | Shape of the `llmBackendConfig` backend onboarding contract |
| `access-contract-version` | Shape of the Citadel Access Contract (products & access policies) |
| `gateway-upgrade-version` | In-place APIM Gateway Upgrade tooling (currently `-preview`) |
| `usage-ingestion-version` | Usage ingestion pipeline (Logic App + Function) |

The deployed manifest is exposed at runtime through the **Release Version API** in API Management:

```bash
curl https://<your-apim-gateway-host>/version
```

This `GET /version` endpoint returns `release.json`. It is created automatically by the **primary deployment** and created/updated
by the **APIM Gateway Upgrade**, so the endpoint always reflects the currently deployed release.

The same API also exposes `GET /version/backend-contract`, which returns the **active LLM backend
routing contract** — a detailed projection of the effective onboarding configuration (APIM target,
full `llmBackendConfig` with per-model metadata, circuit breaker and session affinity settings, model
aliases, and derived pools), plus the `backend-contract-version`:

```bash
curl https://<your-apim-gateway-host>/version/backend-contract
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The primary deployment (`main.bicep`) is used for the **initial implementation** only. After the
> hub is live, the **[APIM Gateway Upgrade](./bicep/infra/apim-gateway-upgrade/README.md)** submodule
> is the standard way to move the accelerator to new releases — applying the new version in place
> without re-provisioning the APIM service or landing-zone infrastructure.

> 📎 For version-track semantics, SemVer rules, and per-track migration guidance, see the
> [**Release Version Management Guide**](./guides/release-version-management.md).
